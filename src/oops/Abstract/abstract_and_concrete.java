// A class which is not declared using abstract keyword is called as Concrete class.
// Concrete class can allow only concrete methods.

// public class Person{
    // concrete class

    // void display(){
    //concrete method implmentation
    // }

// }


//!     2. Abstract Class
// A class which is declared using abstract keyword is called as Abstract class.
// Abstract class can allow both abstract and concrete methods.

// public abstract class Person{
//     void eat(){
    //implementation
//     }

//     abstract void work();
// }
